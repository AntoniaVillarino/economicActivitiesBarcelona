# ECONOMICS ACTIVITIES IN BARCELONA

## 1. Cleaning the data

The dataset for this project is a census of all the **ground floor stores in Barcelona in 2019**, provided by [OpenDataBCN](https://opendata-ajuntament.barcelona.cat/en/).

The dataset can be found here:

The cleaning and aggregations of the data can be found at [1-Data-preparation.ipynb](1-Data-preparation.ipynb)

## 2. Visualizing the data

After cleaning and aggregating the data, I am going to do some Exploratory Data Analysis

The analysis and visualization of the data can be found at [2-Exploratory-data-analysis.ipynb](2-Exploratory-data-analysis.ipynb)

Some interactive maps can be found at [2b-Interactive-EDA.ipynb](2b-Interactive-EDA.ipynb) (NOTE: This notebook uses ipywidgets. This library won't work with Jupyterlab below 3.0, use version 3.0 or jupyter notebook instead)
